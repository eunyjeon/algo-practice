# Dynamic Programming

## 240. Intro to Dynamic Programming

- Dynamic Programming
: " A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing/remembering their solutions."

- Overlapping subproblems and Optimal substructure
  - 2 indicators/properties of DP problems

## 241. Overlapping Subproblems

- DP only works on problems with **optimal substructure & overlapping subproblems**
- A problem is said to have overlapping Subproblems if it can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times
- E.g., Fibonocci sequence
  - repeating subproblems : calculating fib(1) multiple times to get fib(5)

## 242. Optimal Substructure

- A problem is said to have optimal substructure **if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.**
- E.g., shortest path
  - when try to reach D from A, let's say it have shortest path A-B-C-D. Then, A-C is also optimal, and A-B is optimal.
- E.g., Cheapest flight from SFO to NY

## 243-245. Writing a Recursive Solution for Fibonacci algo (Not recommended)

```js
function fib(n) {
  if (n <=1 ) return n
  else return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)
}
```

- Time complexity for the naive solution: O(2^n)

## 246. Memoization

- storing/remembering the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again
- **top-down approach**
- Fibonacci using Memoization

```js
function fib(n, memo=[]) {
  if (memo[n] !== undefined) return memo[n]
  if (n <= 2) return 1
  let res = fib(n-1, memo) + fib(n-2, memo)
  return res
}
```

- Time complexity for the Fib using Memoization: O(n) (Calculate fib(n) only one time for each n)

## 248. Tabulation

- **A bottom up approach**
- Storing the result of a previous result in a "table" (usually an array)
- Usually done using iteration
- **Better sapce** complexity can be achieved using tabulation

```js
funciton fib_tab (n) {
  if (n <= 2) return 1
  let fibNums = [0,1,1]
  for(let i=3; i<=n; i++) {
    fibNums[i] = fibNums[n-1] + fibNums[n-2]
  }
  return fibNums[n]
}
```
