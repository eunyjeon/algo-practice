# Nth Fibonacci

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first number of the sequence is 0, the second number is 1, and the nth number is the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th numbers. Write a function that takes in an integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number.

## test case
  * nthFib(6) //5
  * nthFib(3) //1
  * nthFib(8) //13
  * nthFib(1) //0
