# Algorithm Practice
This is a repository where I do techinical interview prep and practice algorithm problem solving skills. Each subfolder has its own README file and JavaScrpt file with a different whiteboarding or coding challenge question that I've encountered.

Each README file has
* a problem description/prompt
* expected outcomes

Each JS file is structured similarly with
* My first attempts at the problem (mostly with brute force approach without external help)
* Optimized solutions after looking up sources
* Additional notes
* code to run test cases
